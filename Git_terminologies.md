# Git Terminologies

## 1. Repository
A Git repository is the .git/ folder inside a project. 
This repository tracks all changes made to files in your project,
 building a history over time. Meaning, if you delete the .git/ folder, 
 then you delete your projectâ€™s history.
 
 Now, Let's see how we create a git repository
 
$ cd C:/Users/user/my_project
$ git init
$ git add *.c
$ git add LICENSE


## 2. Clone
