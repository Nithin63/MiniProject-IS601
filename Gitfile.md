## Git, Docker, Automated testing, and Continuous Integration 
 
 Following below, we will learn about usage of Git, Docker, Automated testing,
  and Continuous Integration can improve the productivity and competitiveness 
  of a company.

## 1. *Git*
Git is a type of version control system (VCS) that makes it easier to track 
changes to files. 

For example, when you edit a file, git can help you determine 
exactly what changed, who changed it, and why. 

 Git is necessary to track and maintain code specially on team work. 
 
 Git provides  hundreds of comments and configuration which every developer 
 might face in day to day work life. Knowing your everyday tool set increases 
 your productivity as a developer.
 Git is one of those tools you use on a daily basis.

 ## 2. *Docker*
 
 In a production environment, Docker makes it easy to create, deploy, and 
  run applications inside of containers. Containers let developers gather 
  applications and all their core necessities and dependencies into a single 
  package which you can turn into a Docker image and replicate. 
  
  Docker is lightweight, portable, self-contained environments where 
  software runs independently of other software installed on the host machine.
  
  Advantages for Developer
  1. It works on everyone’s machine.
  2. Makes cool tech accessible. Whether you’re building your robot,
   experimenting with AI, or programming a Raspberry Pi, Docker makes it
    easy to work with interesting new technologies.
   3. Raises productivity
   4. Makes cloud migration easy. Docker runs on all the major cloud providers 
   and operating systems, so apps containterized with Docker are portable 
   across datacenters and clouds.
   5. Application upgrades are a lot easier.

 ## *3. Automated Testing*
   Automation testing is a technique to test and 
   compare the actual outcome with the expected outcome. This can be 
   achieved by writing test scripts or using any automation testing tool. 
   
   Test automation is used to automate repetitive tasks and other 
   testing tasks which are difficult to perform manually.
   
   Test Automation focuses on replacing manual human activity with systems
    or devices that enhance efficiency.
    
   Automated testing provides various benefits to developers:
    coverage to detect bugs and errors – 
                                              early and later during the development – and significantly reduces the cost 
                                               of failure, saves time through its repeatability and earlier verification, 
                                               and leverages the improved resource productivity.

## 4. *Continious Integraton*
Continuous Integration (CI) is a development practice where developers
 integrate code into a shared repository frequently, preferably several 
 times a day. Each integration can then be verified by an automated build 
 and automated tests. While automated testing is not strictly part of CI 
 it is typically implied.

One of the key benefits of integrating regularly is that you can detect 
errors quickly and locate them more easily. As each change introduced is 
typically small, pinpointing the specific change that introduced a defect
 can be done quickly.

In recent years CI has become a best practice for software development
 and is guided by a set of key principles. Among them are revision control,
  build automation and automated testing.

Additionally, Continuous Deployment and Continuous Delivery have developed
 as best-practices for keeping your application deployable at any point or 
 even pushing your main codebase automatically into production whenever new 
 changes are brought into it. This allows your team to move fast while keeping 
 high quality standards that can be checked automatically.
