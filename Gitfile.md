##Git, Docker, Automated testing, and Continuous Integration 
 
 Following below, we will learn about usage of Git, Docker, Automated testing,
  and Continuous Integration can improve the productivity and competitiveness 
  of a company.

## 1. Git
Git is a type of version control system (VCS) that makes it easier to track 
changes to files. 

For example, when you edit a file, git can help you determine 
exactly what changed, who changed it, and why. 

 Git is necessary to track and maintain code specially on team work. 
 
 Git provides  hundreds of comments and configuration which every developer 
 might face in day to day work life. Knowing your everyday tool set increases 
 your productivity as a developer.
 Git is one of those tools you use on a daily basis.
 
 ## 2. Docker
 
 In a production environment, Docker makes it easy to create, deploy, and 
  run applications inside of containers. Containers let developers gather 
  applications and all their core necessities and dependencies into a single 
  package which you can turn into a Docker image and replicate. 
  
  Docker is lightweight, portable, self-contained environments where 
  software runs independently of other software installed on the host machine.
  
  Advantages for Developer
  1. It works on everyone’s machine.
  2. Makes cool tech accessible. Whether you’re building your robot,
   experimenting with AI, or programming a Raspberry Pi, Docker makes it
    easy to work with interesting new technologies.
   3. Raises productivity
   4. Makes cloud migration easy. Docker runs on all the major cloud providers 
   and operating systems, so apps containterized with Docker are portable 
   across datacenters and clouds.
   5. Application upgrades are a lot easier.
